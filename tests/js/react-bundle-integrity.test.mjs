/**
 * Guards the COMMITTED React booking-engine bundles
 * (addon-travel-core/js/addons/travel_core/) against regressing to
 * development builds. History: webpack.config.js keyed "production" off
 * NODE_ENV, which the `webpack --mode production` build script never set —
 * so the committed bundles were eval-source-map development builds
 * (1.79 MB total, eval()-wrapped, inline base64 source maps) shipped to
 * every hotel product page. The config now keys off argv.mode; these pins
 * fail the suite if a dev-mode artifact is ever committed again.
