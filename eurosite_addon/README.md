# `eurosite_addon/` — Eurosite Touring provider addon (MVP)

A new CS-Cart provider addon (id **`eurosite`**) for the **Eurosite** XML web
service — a distinct Touroperator platform, a sibling to the existing
`novoton_holidays` and `sphinx_holidays` providers. Built from
`Documentation/Specificatii_API_Eurosite.pdf`.

> **Status: feature-complete provider addon (Cazari individuale vertical).**
> The API protocol layer is live-verified (2026-08-04, account credentials:
> 86 countries, 358 RO cities of ~21,700 total, 116 own-offer cities, 22
> room types; tag catalog empty). On top of it the addon now ships: DB
> persistence for all six static catalogs + cron sync (CLI + HTTP), a
> sphinx-style destination whitelist, an admin dashboard, the unified
> travel_bookings grid integration (mirror dual-write, status callbacks,
> cancel/refresh-fees actions), a destination-driven storefront search with
> the shared travel_core booking engine, the "Condiții de Anulare și Plată"
> modal (live getItemFees), a guest booking form (TGender/DOB pax data),
> and the cart→order→AddBookingRequest pipeline on a hidden carrier
> product. Placeholder pages cover the Pachete/Transport/Circuite modules.
>
> **Known blockers:** (1) the live getHotelPriceRequest currently dies in a
> connection reset after ~6.6s for every variant — search appears not yet
> enabled for this account server-side; raise with Eurosite/TouringIT.
> (2) The addon is deliberately not yet wired into the repo's
> PHPStan/cs-fixer/CI paths (final graduation step).

## The Eurosite protocol

XML over HTTP. Every request is the same envelope (spec: *Autentificarea*):

```xml
<Request RequestType="getHotelPriceRequest">
  <AuditInfo>
    <RequestId>001</RequestId>
    <RequestUser>YourUser</RequestUser>
    <RequestPass>YourPassword</RequestPass>
    <RequestTime>2012-09-04T18:00:46</RequestTime>
    <RequestLang>RO</RequestLang>
  </AuditInfo>
  <RequestDetails> … endpoint payload … </RequestDetails>
</Request>
```

Responses mirror it: `<Response ResponseType="…Response"><AuditInfo/><ResponseDetails>…`.
This is genuinely different from Novoton (form-POST `fn=…`) and Sphinx
(REST/JSON Bearer) — hence a separate addon.

## MVP scope — the "individual accommodations" (Cazari individuale) vertical

`EurositeApiClient` covers the endpoints that make a coherent hotel
search-to-booking flow, mapped 1:1 to the spec:

| Method | Eurosite RequestType | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getCountries()` | getCountryRequest | static: countries |
| `getCities($country)` | getCityRequest | static: cities |
| `getOwnCities()` | getOwnCityRequest | static: cities with own offers (all countries) |
| `getOwnHotels($city)` | getOwnHotelsRequest | static: own hotels + rooms |
| `getRoomTypes()` | getRoomRequest | static: room-type catalog |
| `getTagOffers()` | getTagOffersRequest | static: offer-tag catalog (may be empty) |
| `searchHotels($params)` | getHotelPriceRequest | availability + price search → `HotelOffer[]` |
| `getProductInfo(...)` | getProductInfoRequest | hotel details (description, images, coords) |
| `addBooking($booking)` | AddBookingRequest | create a booking → api/client references |
| `getBooking($ref)` | getBookingRequest | booking status + details |
| `cancelBooking($ref)` | CancelBookingRequest | request cancellation |

**Deferred (spec covers them; not in the MVP):** supplementary services,
item fees / cancellation penalties, packages, transport (charter), circuits,
excursions, and pax modification. The envelope + parser already generalize to
these — they're additional `EurositeApiClient` methods.

**Error contract:** every read method throws `EurositeApiException` when the
server answers with its error envelope (e.g. the `-1000` auth refusal) or an
unparseable body — an API failure is never returned as an empty catalog, so a
future sync job can't mistake "credentials rejected" for "no data".
`addBooking()`/`cancelBooking()` keep returning `ok`/`error` result arrays.

## Configuration

Addon settings (Admin → Add-ons → Eurosite), read via `ConfigProvider`:

- `api_url` — the XML web-service endpoint (default:
  `https://laguna.touringit.ro/server_xml/server.php` — the single URL every
  RequestType is POSTed to)
- `api_user` / `api_password` — the credentials embedded in `<AuditInfo>`
- `tourop_code` — the operator code in payloads (default `EU`)
- `default_currency` (EUR) / `default_language` (RO)
- `allow_insecure_api` — permit http:// transport (dev)
- retry / timeout / circuit-breaker tuning

There are **no default credentials** — the spec ships placeholders
(`YourUser`/`YourPassword`), so nothing here authenticates until you enter
the real account keys. **Credentials are required for every service, static
data included**: with an invalid account the server answers every request
with `ErrorId -1000` ("You are not authorised to access this server!"), and
with a valid account the same requests answer from any host (verified live
2026-08-04; the earlier "IP allowlist" reading of -1000 was wrong). The
endpoint URL ships as the default above (HTTPS, on the touringit.ro platform
Eurosite runs on); the spec's sample payloads reference the same platform
(`EU.touringit.ro` asset links).

Live own-hotels data on this platform reports `Touropcode` **`LA`** (Laguna),
not the spec-example `EU` the `tourop_code` setting defaults to — confirm the
right code for your account with the operator before relying on
search/booking payloads.

## Testing

```bash
cd eurosite_addon/app/addons/eurosite
composer install                 # once, for phpunit
vendor/bin/phpunit               # 30 tests, 138 assertions
```

The tests inject a fake transport (`EurositeTransportInterface`) that captures
the request the client builds and returns canned responses copied from the
spec, so both request-building and response-mapping are verified without
network. The code is PHPStan level-10 clean and PSR-12 formatted.

## Graduation (next steps, in order)

1. ~~Install & smoke-test static data~~ — done 2026-08-04 (all six services
   answer live; `dev/eurosite/` probes cover each one).
2. ~~Persistence + cron~~ — done: 8 tables, 9 cron modes (CLI `cron.php` +
   `eurosite_cron.run`), sync log, dashboard quick actions
   (`Documentation/CRON_JOBS.txt` has the schedule).
3. ~~Whitelist, admin, bookings grid, storefront search + booking pipeline~~ —
   done (see Status above).
4. **Live search/booking smoke test** — BLOCKED on the server-side search
   outage (constant ~6.6s connection reset); once Eurosite enables search
   for the account, run a full search → book → cancel cycle on the docker
   store.
5. **Wire into the CI gates**: add the addon's `src`/`controllers`/`func.php`
   to `phpstan.neon`, `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php`, the CI `php -l` step, and a
   PHPUnit coverage job — the same treatment novoton/sphinx get.
