 * Read by fn_travel_core_seed_language_keys() (func.php), which UPSERTs every
 * entry into ?:language_values whenever this file or addon.xml changes (hash
 * probe in init.php). That is what lets NEW or CHANGED labels reach stores that
 * are already installed — CS-Cart only imports addon.xml/.po at install time.
 *
 * addon.xml entries are merged on top of this file, so a key declared in both
 * takes its value from addon.xml. Keep the two in sync when a key exists in
 * both; use this file alone for runtime-only keys.
